This presentation is intended for the people who haven't dived into the UI performance yet. You will see some examples of easy and fast ways to check if your app works well and if it is not, how to find the potential problem.<br>In the presentation, Artur will tell you about:<ul><li>How android renders views and why does it matter to you (DisplayLists, Choreographer, VSync, Render Thread - things that will be covered)<li>How to understand that you have a problem (GPU profiling, SysTrace)<li>How to get metrics about the current rendering speed (fps) of your app (dumpsys gfxinfo, Systrace, HierarchyViewer)<li>Some of their mistakes they made, how he found them and how he fixed them (overlaying Controllers (analog of Fragments), incorrect usage of RecyclerView with NestedScrollViewHow to easily find GPU overdraw and fix it (using GPU overdraw in dev settings and export view layers in HierarchyViewer or Scalpel to show you the ways to improve)<li>How to be sure that the problem doesn’t regress (Android Vitals, dumpsys gfxinfo)</ul>","audience_level":"Intermediate","language":"EN","speakers_keys":["speaker-artur-badretdinov"]},"talk-kotlin-sandwich":{"title":"Making a Kotlin, Architecture Components, Rx and Coroutines sandwich","description_html":"Architecture keeps being a buzzword in the Android world, even though years have passed since we've seen the first version of the OS. Problems like orientation changes, navigation, data mapping, parsing or display are still around us, and we struggle to make them go away.<br>Using Kotlin and it's Coroutines, enveloping the application in Rx and finalizing it with Architecture Components, we can bring the end to nuisances that these problems cause. By heavily relying on generics, asynchronous programming and data persistance, we're able to make a solution, that fits most applications and has an understandable API.","audience_level":"Intermediate","language":"EN","speakers_keys":["speaker-filip-babic"]},"talk-callbacks-hell":{"title":"If callbacks are hell, are coroutines the way to heaven?","description_html":"This talk will focus on use cases on Android, but most of it can perfectly be applied on other platforms.<br>While nearly all apps need to perform computations or I/O asynchronously, often off the UI thread (to avoid UI freezes on blocking calls), the solutions have never been straightforward. You could choose between AsyncTask, threads, executors or third-party java libraries, but couldn't avoid the callback hell. Coroutines which came in Kotlin 1.1 are changing this.<br>Kotlin coroutines allow to write code that reads like a good recipe, line by line, without jumps, yet, doesn't block the calling thread.<br>This talk will show how coroutines are relevant in many Android components (ViewModels, Jobs, Services, Activities/Fragments, Views…), for I/O, UI animations, Google Play Services Tasks API usage, and custom async logic.<br>But that's not all. I'll show you how you can take down any callback hell and do things you'd not have done before because it would have polluted your code base too much. You'll also see how Kotlin coroutines can help you handle errors more easily, and exhaustively.<br>Bluetooth Low Energy, a great callback hell example, can also get good with coroutines, and I'll show how I Made GATT Great Again! If you have some safe BLE devices we can connect to, please, bring them at the conference!<br>Camera2 has another big callback hell, plus a complex state machine, and I'll also show how to remove it with coroutines and other Kotlin language features!<br>What you'll learn here will enable you to better take advantage of coroutines features to solve complex problems and deal with hard or badly designed APIs you can't escape.","audience_level":"Intermediate","language":"EN","speakers_keys":["speaker-louis-cad"]},"talk-kotlin-quality":{"title":"Kotlin on Code Quality Tools","description_html":"Some might have heard about code quality tools such as Checkstyle, PMD, Findbugs, Lint, Detekt and others but which ones are applicable to Kotlin?<br>I'll list a bunch of tools, explain what they can do, touch on how they work and most importantly show you how you can start using them to be more productive and save a lot of time.<br>With the help of these analyzers you can focus on coding conventions in your team, catch a few bugs and concentrate on what really matters when reviewing code.","audience_level":"Beginner","language":"EN","speakers_keys":["speaker-niklas-baudy"]},"talk-dependency-injection":{"title":"Dependency Injection Pattern for iOS App","description_html":"Dependency injection (DI) was introduced as one of the modern best practices at a past WWDC, and is getting popular to make an app maintainable, scalable and testable. To apply DI pattern, a DI container is often used to define a dependency graph to retrieve instances with their dependencies resolved.<br>In this talk, the original author of Swinject, the most popular DI framework for Swift, will introduce DI pattern for an iOS app. The talk is based on the speaker's experience developing a production app used by tens of millions of users.<br>The talk covers:<ul><li> Basic concept and motivation of dependency injection in dependency inversion principle.<li>Comparison of iOS architectures, e.g. MVC, MVVM and VIPER.<li>Introduction of a minimum architecture to apply dependency injection.<br>- Practical structure to configure dependency definitions using Swinject Container, Assembly and Assembler.<li>Unit testing with test doubles and dependency injection.","audience_level":"Intermediate","language":"EN","speakers_keys":["speaker-yoichi-tagaya"]},"talk-rust-sharing":{"title":"Sharing Code between iOS & Android with Rust","description_html":"When having to share code between iOS and Android, most companies choose C++. It is a well known language with very good tooling, but it also has a lot of pitfalls. For one, it is a very complex language. It also makes it really easy to accidentally introduce memory leaks or segmentation faults; especially if you're used to automatic memory management via a GC (Kotlin) or Arc (Swift). It also looks quite different from modern language like Swift or Kotlin. Now that we iOS developers got (mostly) rid of Objective-C, and Android Developers got (mostly) rid of Java, it feels archaic having to go back to a language with an archaic Syntax like C++.<br>Rust looks and feels a lot like Kotlin or Swift, and it offers the same easy ways of sharing code as C++. In addition to that, Rust has a very safe memory management model, high performance, a way to do fearless concurrency, and a very rich package ecosystem. As a bonus, it compiles to WebAssembly, so the shared code could also be used in any HTML5 app. At XING, we started some experiments in Rust in order to find out whether it would be useful to leverage it for code sharing. We're not using it in production yet or anything, but I feel like it would still be nice to introduce it to more developers so they can also start doing some experiments.","audience_level":"Beginner","language":"EN","speakers_keys":["speaker-benedikt-terhechte"]},"talk-green-rocket":{"title":"Living on a green rocket field","description_html":"At Google IO 2018 the Android team announced Jetpack for Android, which is an opinionated set of libraries and architecture, which is a recommendation for Android developers.
