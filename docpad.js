You could choose between AsyncTask, threads, executors or third-party java libraries, but couldn't avoid the callback hell. Coroutines which came in Kotlin 1.1 are changing this.<br>Kotlin coroutines allow to write code that reads like a good recipe, line by line, without jumps, yet, doesn't block the calling thread.<br>This talk will show how coroutines are relevant in many Android components (ViewModels, Jobs, Services, Activities/Fragments, Views…), for I/O, UI animations, Google Play Services Tasks API usage, and custom async logic.<br>But that's not all. I'll show you how you can take down any callback hell and do things you'd not have done before because it would have polluted your code base too much. You'll also see how Kotlin coroutines can help you handle errors more easily, and exhaustively.<br>Bluetooth Low Energy, a great callback hell example, can also get good with coroutines, and I'll show how I Made GATT Great Again! If you have some safe BLE devices we can connect to, please, bring them at the conference!<br>Camera2 has another big callback hell, plus a complex state machine, and I'll also show how to remove it with coroutines and other Kotlin language features!<br>What you'll learn here will enable you to better take advantage of coroutines features to solve complex problems and deal with hard or badly designed APIs you can't escape.",

It also makes it really easy to accidentally introduce memory leaks or segmentation faults; especially if you're used to automatic memory management via a GC (Kotlin) or Arc (Swift). It also looks quite different from modern language like Swift or Kotlin. Now that we iOS developers got (mostly) rid of Objective-C, and Android Developers got (mostly) rid of Java, it feels archaic having to go back to a language with an archaic Syntax like C++.<br>Rust looks and feels a lot like Kotlin or Swift, and it offers the same easy ways of sharing code as C++. In addition to that, Rust has a very safe memory management model, high performance, a way to do fearless concurrency, and a very rich package ecosystem. As a bonus, it compiles to WebAssembly, so the shared code could also be used in any HTML5 app. At XING, we started some experiments in Rust in order to find out whether it would be useful to leverage it for code sharing. We're not using it in production yet or anything, but I feel like it would still be nice to introduce it to more developers so they can also start doing some experiments.",

Data and behavior driven testing combined with specifications can give you more freedom - I will show how to apply those strategies to everyday development.<br>Besides of general ideas, I will discuss Kotlin and Android testing frameworks. You will also learn how we managed to tailor testing patterns for specific problems.<br>I hope that after my talk you will have bunch of ideas to be more productive while writing tests.",

Later, in 2006, we developed global traffic services and connected navigation applications for drivers to outsmart traffic congestion altogether. Currently, we help drivers navigating their electric vehicles, making sure they do not run out of battery and so we fight range anxiety. Going forward, we already enabling automated vehicles to see beyond its physical sensors by remapping the world in centimeter accuracy and building applications that assist people’s drive or even drive a car all on their own – more safely and more efficient as human drivers.",
