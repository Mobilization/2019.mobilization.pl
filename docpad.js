In addition to that, Rust has a very safe memory management model, high performance, a way to do fearless concurrency, and a very rich package ecosystem. As a bonus, it compiles to WebAssembly, so the shared code could also be used in any HTML5 app. At XING, we started some experiments in Rust in order to find out whether it would be useful to leverage it for code sharing.

Currently, we help drivers navigating their electric vehicles, making sure they do not run out of battery and so we fight range anxiety.
