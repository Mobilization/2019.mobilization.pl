                    All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at Mobilization conference are required to
                    agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the
                    event. We do not tolerate harassment of Mobilization participants in any form. We expect
                    cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

                    Mobilization policy extends to talks, forums, workshops, codelabs, social media, parties,
                    hallway conversations, all attendees, partners, sponsors, volunteers, event staff. Sexual
                    language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops,
                    parties, Facebook, Twitter and other online media. You catch our drift. Mobilization reserves
                    the right to refuse admittance to, or remove any person from the conference at any time in its
                    sole discretion. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled
                    from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

                    clothing/uniforms/costumes or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
                    sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.Participants
                    and exhibiting partners or sponsors disobeying this policy will be notified and are expected to
